# Vacuuming my keyboard
What are you "typing" while vacuuming your keyboard. A modern art approach!

## What is this?
Every week I clean my room and vacuum the keyboard of my MacBook.

While vacuuming my keyboard, I fire up a texteditor so I don't mess anything up.
The files here are the "things" I type on the keyboard while vacuuming the keyboard.
(truly created throught vacuuming. No space for fake ones!).

## So this is art?
[Some people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Beuys) smear fat in a corner and call it art.

This is another kind of art!

## WTF rly? / You're dumb
Ok.
